# Changes

Modifications to the upstream sources in this repo. Entries tagged
`[upstream-candidate]` describe changes that could plausibly be
contributed back to monoscad as a PR.

## Baselines

- **monoscad**: [smkent/monoscad@a980c0e](https://github.com/smkent/monoscad/commit/a980c0e4a83d43316286d994b0bda67a6889529a)
  (main as of 2026-05-03), specifically:
  - `rugged-box/rugged-box.scad`
  - `rugged-box/rugged-box-library.scad` (identical to
    `gridfinity/rugged-box/rugged-box-library.scad`; one copy retained)
  - `gridfinity/rugged-box/rugged-box-gridfinity.scad`
- **gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad**: [kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad@910e22d](https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad/commit/910e22d8607fd7f5f51ad5e5cbc5287a76810bfd)
  (2025-08-31). Initial import was pinned at `0b7bf6e` (2024-01-29)
  to match Stephen's original tested API; bumped to `910e22d` on
  2026-05-03 — see migration entry below.

## 2026-05-03 — Initial import

- Imported the three rugged-box sources listed above into `src/`.
- Submoduled `lib/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad` at the pin above.
- Adjusted `include`/`use` paths in `src/rugged-box-gridfinity.scad`
  to reference `../lib/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad/` (Stephen's
  originals assumed the library was at `OPENSCADPATH` or in a sibling
  `gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad/` directory).

### `[upstream-candidate]` Add `Stand_On_Back` parameter and stand-feet module

Adds an optional pair of feet at the bottom-back of the box bottom,
matching the hinge protrusion, so the closed box can stand upright on
its back edge.

- `src/rugged-box-library.scad` — new `stand_on_back` arg on the `rbox`
  module, plumbed through to a new `_box_stand_feet` module which uses
  a new `_box_stand_foot_body` helper. Wired into both `assembled_open`
  and `assembled_closed` previews.
- `src/rugged-box.scad` — `Stand_On_Back` customizer parameter passed
  to `rbox`.
- `src/rugged-box-gridfinity.scad` — same wiring on the Gridfinity
  variant.

### `[upstream-candidate]` Parameterize Gridfinity cell size

Adds a `Cell_Size` customizer parameter to the Gridfinity rugged-box
(default 42 mm, range 30–50 mm in 0.5 mm steps), replacing the
hardcoded `l_grid` constant from gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad. Allows
non-standard Gridfinity grids (e.g., metric-imperial hybrids,
shrunk/expanded layouts).

- `src/rugged-box-gridfinity.scad` — `Cell_Size` parameter; all
  `l_grid` references in dimension calculations, rib positioning,
  baseplate generation, and stacking-lip generation rebound to
  `Cell_Size`.

## 2026-05-03 — `[upstream-candidate]` Migrate to current kennetek API

Bumped the `lib/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad` submodule from `0b7bf6e`
(Jan 2024) to `910e22d` (Aug 2025), and updated
`src/rugged-box-gridfinity.scad` to match the refactored kennetek API.

**Imports** — added direct imports for the relocated symbols:
- `include` of `standard.scad` now from `src/core/`
- new `use` of `src/core/base.scad` (was in `gridfinity-rebuilt-utility.scad`)
- new `use` of `src/core/gridfinity-rebuilt-holes.scad` for `bundle_hole_options`
- new `use` of `src/helpers/shapes.scad` for `rounded_square`

**Renamed constants:**
- `h_lip` → `STACKING_LIP_HEIGHT` (3.548 → 4.4 mm)
- `h_base` → `BASE_HEIGHT` (5 → 7 mm)
- `h_hole` → `MAGNET_HOLE_DEPTH` (2.4 mm, unchanged value)
- `r_base` → `BASE_TOP_RADIUS` (4 → 3.75 mm)

The base/lip dimension drift means the rendered Z-geometry of the
Gridfinity bottom and the lid's mating top base differ slightly from
the previous version. Both halves consistently use the new constants,
so they remain self-compatible.

**Function signatures:**
- `gridfinityBaseplate(W, L, l, dx, dy, sp, magnets, sh, fitx, fity)`
  → `gridfinityBaseplate([W, L], l, [dx, dy], sp, hole_options, sh, [fitx, fity])`
  with `magnets` boolean replaced by a `bundle_hole_options(...)` bundle.
- `gridfinityBase(gx, gy, l, dx, dy, style_hole, off=, …)`
  → `gridfinityBase([gx, gy], [l, l], hole_options, …)`. The `off`
  parameter is gone; replaced with a uniform XY `scale()` wrapper that
  reproduces the inset (`-0.2mm` at the one callsite that needs it).

**Module replacement:**
- `rounded_rectangle(w, l, h, r)` → `linear_extrude(h) rounded_square([w, l], r, center=true)`.

**New helper:**
- `gridfinity_hole_options()` — local function that produces the
  `bundle_hole_options(...)` bundle, factoring out shared options
  (`crush_ribs=true`, `chamfer=true`) so both call sites stay in sync.

**Verification:** every `Part` value (12 total) renders cleanly with no
OpenSCAD errors or warnings, across all four `Gridfinity_Base_Style`
options, with `Gridfinity_Stackable` on/off, with `Stand_On_Back`
on/off, and at non-standard `Cell_Size` values (30, 38, 50). Print fit
of the new stacking-lip / top-base interface has not yet been
physically verified.

## Future work

- **Print-fit verification of the migrated lid/base interface.**
  The lid's top base uses a `scale()` workaround in place of the old
  `gridfinityBase(off=-0.2)` 0.2 mm fit-tolerance inset. Behaviorally
  equivalent in CSG, but worth a printed test before declaring final.
- **Optionally expose `bundle_hole_options(...)` flags as customizer
  parameters** (refined holes, screw holes, supportless magnet pockets,
  thumbscrew bases). Currently `gridfinity_hole_options()` hardcodes
  `crush_ribs=true, chamfer=true` and disables the rest.
